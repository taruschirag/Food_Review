# Food_Review
An ongoing project to determine the most popular dishes at a restaurant (Little Italy, India.)

# Technology Used
I scraped the data using an external application made specifically for scraping google reviews. I then used Named-Entitiy Recognition model to recognize the food names in the reviews. NLP is then used to analyze the sentiment of the review for that food item. 
I then plan to rank the dishes based on how many positive and negative reviews each dish got and present it in a datatable. (This part is ongoing)
